The increasing demand for convenience foods, coupled with the rise in consumer preference for fresh, high-quality bread products with extended shelf life, is a major driver of market growth. Par-baked bread provides an efficient solution for retailers and foodservice operators, as it can be quickly finished in-store or at foodservice locations, offering superior freshness compared to fully baked alternatives.
